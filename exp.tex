Table \ref{table:setup} gives the configuration of the hardware used for the experiments.

We mimicked the operators of Postgres in our own code. We also modified Multi2sim \cite{multi2sim} in order to include Phase Change Memory in the memory hierarchy. We instrumented to code to include the metrics of writes and wear distribution for various algorithms.

We used TPCH 1GB database for our experiments. We ran each query at different selectivity points in order to compare our algorithms with native Postgres algorithms.
